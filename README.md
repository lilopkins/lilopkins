### Hi there 👋

I'm Lily (she/her), a developer 👩‍💻, student pilot 👩‍✈️ and vegan 🌿. I usually work in [Rust] or [Java], but regularly check out and use other languages!

I have experience in:
- Rust (since 2017)
- Java (since 2011)
- Web stack (HTML/JS/CSS/TS, since 2013)
- Docker (since 2017)
- Bash (since 2014)
- Python (since 2013)
- C (since 2015)
- some Kubernetes (since 2022)

I am a big believer in openness 📖, accessibility 💯 and transparency 🔍.

Jag har lärt mig svenska i min fritid också. Jag kan (och vill!) flytta till Sverige för rätt jobb. 🇸🇪

Some of my more interesting repos to check out are:

- [`metar`] (Rust) for parsing aviation weather reports 🌡.
- [`lnk`] (Rust) for parsing Windows shell link files 🏷.
- [`flipper-starter-project`] (C), a proposal for a better way to structure and build applications targeting the Flipper Zero 🐬.
