### Hi there 👋

I'm Lily (she/her), a developer 👩‍💻, student pilot 👩‍✈️ and vegan 🌿. I usually work in [Rust], [Java] or [Scala], but regularly check out and use other languages!

I have experience in:
- Java (since 2011)
- Web stack (HTML/JS/CSS/TS, since 2013)
- Bash (since 2014)
- Python (since 2013, particularly with TensorFlow and Django)
- C (since 2015)
- Docker (since 2017)
- Rust (since 2019)
- some Kubernetes (since 2022)
- Scala (since 2022)

I am a big believer in openness 📖, accessibility 💯 and transparency 🔍.

Jag lär mig svenska i min fritid också. Jag är öppna för att flytta till Sverige för bra jobbet. 🇸🇪

Some of my more interesting repos to check out are:

- [`metar`] (Rust) for parsing aviation weather reports 🌡.
- [`lnk`] (Rust) for parsing Windows shell link files 🏷.
- [`flipper-starter-project`] (C), a proposal for a better way to structure and build applications targeting the Flipper Zero 🐬.
